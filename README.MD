Welcome to A Purrfect Mystery!

*SUMMARY*
Welcome to the mystery where you're the detective. First, open the case file to learn about your next assignment. Read through the story to determine next steps. When you're ready to begin solving the mystery, click on the Investigate! button and you'll begin the adventure. 

*HOW TO PLAY*
As you read through the story you'll be asked to choose one of two options after each clue. These choices impact your Investigaor Status and the health of your subject (in this case, Sherlock Meows). Watch the status bars on the left side navigation to assess your progres as an Investigator and the wellbeing of your cat. The ultimate goal is to achieve Legend Status as an Investigator and for your cat to still have nine lives at the end of the story.

Investigator Status:
Level 1 - Novice
Level 2 - Junior 
Level 3 - Senior
Level 4 - Legend

Determine your status and cat lives at the end of the story by clicking on the "Check Status" button. This will also tell you the outcome of the investigation.

Restart the story by clicking the "Restart Story" button on the navigation bar.

-Modify the status bars to reflect the level achieved instead of a percentage.
-Add graphics in the choice buttons to make the asthetic consistent or update the font family.
-Using two html pages has created some bubbling issues that need to be fully resolved. This has impacted the modal on the home page.
